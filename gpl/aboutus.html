    <h4>About the Gooding Library Pokemon League</h4>
    <p>
        Officially known as the Gooding Public Library Pokemon Club/League, the Gooding Library Pokemon League (GPL) is a program under the Gooding Public Library and officially sanctioned by The Pokémon Company International (TCPi) as part of their “Play! Pokemon” League program.  GPL was founded in December 2021 as a response to a need to build a program/community where fans of the bigger Pokemon franchise and card game can come together and play together.  Since then, GPL has grown is known in the City of Gooding, Idaho and in the Magic Valley area as a family friendly program where anyone can come in, learn about the card game and build friendships.
