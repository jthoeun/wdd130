    <h2>"Who am I?" and intoduction</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Johnny Thoeun. 
    <br> This will be my first semester back after taking an extended break from online classes.  
    <br>Iâ€™m originally from the Northern Virginia area and currently living in Gooding, Idaho.  
    <br>Gooding is a small rural town just 30-35 miles northwest of Twin Falls. It is a totally different life out here compared to the busy city life back east. 
    <br>I have been married for over 2 years and have a 15 month old son with another son on the way in December. 
    <br>On my free time from work and now school work, I like to play board games and video games. 
    <br> I also started a library program involving the Pokemon Trading Card Game and started a league/club to support the community on the weekend.</p>
